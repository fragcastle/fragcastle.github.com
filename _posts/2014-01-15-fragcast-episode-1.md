FragCast is a weekly podcast where the founders of Frag Castle Games talk about the latest progress on their games, the video game industry, pop culture and the ups and downs of running a super-small, lean startup.


Wherein we talk about how we got into game development, how we named Rock Kickass, Family Guy, game engines, unity, impactjs, gamemaker and other things.
