### In This Episode
Jared and John talk about

This week we're all about making your debugging life easier, dealing with gravity and video game performance.

- We’re making progress and feeling pretty good!
- Jared gave Rock [the ability to slide under enemy fire](https://twitter.com/fragcastle/status/601849742793035777).  [Got some good feedback about it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fragcastle/status/602321863738531841).
- John’s working on a level where Rock is falling from a building.  We’re “simulating” him falling by making everything else *look* like their moving around him.  Now we have to customize everything to complete the illusion.
- Jared has added a ton of features to the debug view in ImpactJS.  This week he added a way to overlay the collision map on the scene to debug destructible terrain issues.
- We talked a little about how awesome the Chrome Dev Tools are.
- You should learn JavaScript if you haven’t already. Don’t know how to program?  You should still learn JavaScript!
- Finding good games to play with a 5-year is tough.

### Currently Playing?
  - Jared’s still playing Not a Hero and not ashamed to admit it.
  - John’s got back into Day of Defeat a little!?  Had to disable mouse acceleration.
