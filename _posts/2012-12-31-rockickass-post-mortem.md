## Origins of Rock Kickass
Rock Kickass. The name still cracks me up. Rock. Kickass. Once we named the game, everything else slid into place. Without the name, we just had the "[pitch sketch](/assets/site/img/game-off-pitch-concept.png)" that I made and an idea.

We loved MegaMan and the overall concept of that game: a character who _merges_ the powers of the enemies that he kills and makes them his own. John pitched the idea and we decided to run with it as our homage to Megaman and early 90's nintendo games. The concept gave us a lot of interesting

_What would the merge animation look like? How would we progam it? How many different types of enemies would we need? What would they look like?_

Yeah, I pretty much fell in love with this game as soon as I heard the pitch from John.

### Things that worked

 **1. Our Process**. Seriously. Frag Castle doesn't have an office. John and I both work out of our homes/coffee shops most of the time. Early on there was some confusion as to what we were building but after our initial concept was pitched and we had a character sprite done, things really started to pick up.

 We also realized pretty early on that we weren't going to be able to deliver 100% of what we imagined for RK and we made certain to commit to a core set of gameplay that we could absolutely deliver by the submission deadline.

 **2. Concept**. I think our concept for Rock Kickass is pretty sound. Our overall idea may not be the most original (seriously capcom, please don't sue us!) but I really like the world we were able to bring to life in RK.

**3. The product**. We're both insanely proud of Rock Kickass. It's not _perfect_ but it's ours and we love it.

### Things that did not work

 **1. Life**. Both John and I have day jobs and families. Most of the work we did on Rock Kickass was done off hours, [3pm to 9pm was our average](https://github.com/fragcastle/rock-kickass/graphs/punch-card) work-day. There were more than a few times where I fell asleep at the keyboard while play-testing or doing artwork for RK.

 **2. Creative Commons Assets**. Early on we spent a lot of time trolling through CC art sites (because we were _terrified_ of attempting to do the art ourselves.) looking for tilesets, characters, anything. We realized that we were spinning too much on picking tilesets that looked good and fit the tone of the game we wanted to make.

 There may be some studios out there that can make a cohesive game with CC art assets, but we're not one of them.

 **3. Poor Planning**. This may seem like a bit of a contradiction, hell we listed "Process" as the #1 thing that went _right_! Early on both John and I had a hard time communicating where we wanted to go with RK.

 We eventually got over this and started sharing ideas openly and without hesitation or worry of critique. In fact, I think we both craved the critique. We wanted someone else to vet our idea and show us it wouldn't work or take it and improve it.

## Conclusion

John summed up the experience perfectly:

> Everything just came together and I'm really happy with the game that we submitted. I have a deeper understanding of how impact works, I learned how to work with impact nuances (mainly weltmeister), and learned some things about level design (albeit, not much :P).

We both had a hell of a time building RK v1 and we can't wait to get back to it!
