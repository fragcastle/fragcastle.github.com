### In This Episode
Jared and John talk about

THE PODCAST CAN NOW LEGALLY DRINK! WOOOOO PAAARTY. LETS TALK ABOUT GAMES!!!! Why are you shouting? I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T CONTROL MY VOLUME!!!

Another perfectly executed Episode of fragcast.

We're launching a DIY Organic Grass-fed Wallet company. Basically we dropship you a baby cow, you handle everything else.

We talk about [this amazing gif](http://i.imgur.com/73tVcAG.gif) for a while. Kangaroos are adorable, but also terrifying.

OK, BACK TO GAME DEV THINGS.

This week has been a pretty unproductive week for us (yeah, we're going to fire us just as soon as we make money). We did some art and level design this week, but not anything really worth mentioning.

Jared has been playing [Not A Hero](http://www.devolverdigital.com/games/view/not-a-hero) and loves the 2d side-scrolling action with cover mechanics.

John has been playing Super Meat Boy, mostly to see if he can use his ps3 controller with his Mac - turns out he can, and he's super excited about it!

John does some digging and finds out that Not A Hero was built with [Click Team Fusion](http://www.clickteam.com/), an engine we're not familiar with but looks like it has a lot of features.
