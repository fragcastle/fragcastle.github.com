We go a little longer than usual but this episode is full of good things: Jared and John talk about

- We're open-sourcing our trello hubot plugin, ingeniously named [hubot-trello](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-trello)
- Looking for a great way to communicate with your team? [Slack](http://www.slack.com) is a tool that we've been using for a long time and we're in love with it.
- Trinket Studios has launched their [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/trinket/battle-chef-brigade) for [Battle Chef Brigade](http://www.battlechefbrigade.com/blog/). You play as a magical chef who hunts monsters to prepare amazing dishes to serve to judges!! You should back this!!
- We discuss the new game we're working on: Death Hole. It's a lightweight adventure game for mobile devices. The game centers on a small town with a dark past - and a large hole that has claimed a lot of lives.
- John and Jared have both submitted talks to the [New England Code Camp](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC22/Sessions) in November. We'll see if we get in :D
