If you're weighing your options between writing your own game engine and using Unity2d or *insert-another-game-engine-here* we all think that learning a popular game engine is almost always going to be easier than building your own. However, if you're more focused on learning the fundamentals of game engine design then you can certainly build your own and Jared thinks this is one of the better ways to learn but there are also a bunch of open source game engines that you can use as reference:

* [Duality](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality)
* [Fail Engine](http://www.failengine.com/)
* [Cocos2d](http://cocos2d.org/) - not based off of XNA but still a good open source 2d game engine to learn from
* [NetGore](http://www.netgore.com/) - again, not based of XNA but another good engine to look at

Console are still a big market, but it seems that the people interested in consoles are also interested in having a "all-in-one" entertainment device (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, etc). Mobile seems to be focusing more on satisfying gamers when they aren't at home. Also, mobile is just a larger market to play with than console at this point. Pretty much everyone on the planet has a mobile phone. We're thinking that consoles are here to stay but mobile has the numbers to make things very interesting. Ask us again in 5 years :D

* Jared tends to crawl into a cave and do nothing to recharge himself when he gets burned out.
* John points out that it could just be all of the baggage you're dealing with and not necessarily the workload itself. John says that taking a timeout and refocusing yourself on whats actually important can help you keep your sanity.
* Keith mentions that people recharge differently and that you should figure out what works best for you. Keith loves to hang out with a bunch of energized people to get his energy levels back up.
