### In This Episode
Jared and John talk about

- Jared has pretty much stopped working on his 1GAM at this point, trying to make his demo game for his talk at [Lowell Indies](http://www.meetup.com/Lowell-Independent-Game-Development-Meetup/events/219790178/) as good as possible
- John is wrapping up work on two Flappy Bird inspired games: Spooky Ghost and Lovey Bird. In Lovey Bird you have to drop down to deliver valentines while dodging houses
- John has scheduled our first meetup! We're meeting February 3rd, at the [Higgins Lab, at WPI in Worcester, MA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Higgins+Laboratories,+Worcester+Polytechnic+Institute,+West+St,+Worcester,+MA+01609/@42.2741738,-71.8082228,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e40658bfe4955d:0x1bcad5db1c9dd1ae). We'll start at 6pm and kill it around 9pm.
