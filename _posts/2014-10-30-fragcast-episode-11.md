### In This Episode
Jared and John talk about

 - We were pretty sick when we recorded this episode. We're sorry, but thankfully you cannot be infected only assaulted (audibly) by us
 - John thinks that halloween is a great time of the year to commit crimes with masks
 - We want the [micromachines guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Moschitta,_Jr.) to handle all of our legalese, if you can hook us up find Jared on linked in and make the connection
 - Jared has been playtesting **Rock Kickass** this week, specifically focusing on the parallax effect for our levels
 - John pitches 2.5d right when Jared is dinking and almost causes him to choke
 - We talk through some pros and cons related to making 2.5d and maybe make **Rock Kickass** 2.5d
 - We are thinking that we're assigning too much importance to features and code in **Rock Kickass** just because it's been there, we need to look at the game with fresh eyes and focus on the original gameplay goals
 - John has been working on **RK Runner** but is having a problem with how the UI buttons are being sized on different phone resolutions
 - John details a bit how our build system for **RK Runner** works, it's not perfect - as he explains - but it gets the job done
 - We go all ADHD and talk about Surface Pro 3 and impulse buying
 - John recently got Titan Fall (guess what he's been playing lately)
 - with a segue as subtle as a high-yield nuclear detonation we start discussing [the new Retro Video Game magazin kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/socalmike/retro-video-game-magazine-year-two)
 - Jared is really excited about [Battle Chef Brigade](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/trinket/battle-chef-brigade) and you should be too
 - Xamarin is working on a version of Mono for the Unreal Engine. It's super-beta right now, which is a fancy way of saying that you need very specific version of both Unreal and Mono to get it to work. Check out the [blog post](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2014/Oct-23.html) for more info.
 - Friend of the show and former [Frag Castle Employee #3](http://fragcastle.com/fragcast/2014/01/26/fragcast-episode-3/) has raised $1000 for [Extra-Life](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?)
 - John shows off his call-of-duty-inspired halloween costume (sorry audio-only peeps) and Jared is convinced he's going to get shot
