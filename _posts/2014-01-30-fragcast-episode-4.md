### In This Episode
Jared, John and Keith discuss

* Layoffs and acquisitions at Zynga send a mixed message to the crew at Frag Castle.
* Colorblindness and accessibility in games. Making games as accessible as possible
* Amazon is now offering indies the ability to upload games to be sold on their PC and Mac software stores.

### Currently Playing?
 * John is playing through Dark Souls, he's made it through the depths and is fighting through blight town.
 * Jared finished the main story line for Shadowrun Returns, and is a fan of downloading other peoples content and playing through
 * Keith just completed the story line of Marvel Lego, and spent 3 hours just unlocking extra characters. He's playing Space Chem, which is a fantastic indie game by Zachtronics.

### Favorite games
 * Keiths favorite game is Dark Souls, followed closely by Shadows of the collosus
 * John loved counterstrike back in what we like to call "The Day". Now it's hard to pick a favorite: all valve titles, Natural Selection, Battlefield.
 * Jared pitches Fallout 2 as the best game ever. After Fallout, Full Throttle is Jared's second favorite game.

### Current Events
 * Zynga laid off 314 people and acquired NaturalMotion for $527mil. Can anyone say "Mixed Signals"?
 * Gearbox is releasing a colorblind update for Borderlands 2. If you're working on a video game it's really easy to see how colorblind people will react to your game. Check out [Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org/) for Windows and Mac, and [ColorDeBlind](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/colordeblind-how-color-blind/id513529073?mt=8) for iOs.

### Questions we stole from teh internets

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I feel like 95% of successful games of today are multiplayer in SOME way. Idk if a level editor/sharer counts? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gamedev&amp;src=hash">#gamedev</a></p>&mdash; Richard Georgeoff 3 (@TeddyNashor) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeddyNashor/statuses/429049531620024320">January 31, 2014</a></blockquote>

Anything you can add to your game to bring people together either when they are in the same room, or when they are separated by miles or even by borders

    Looking to start a devblog for my WIP game. Are most using WP? What might others be using? <cite><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1vfww8/looking_to_start_a_devblog_for_my_wip_game_are/">hellz99</a></cite>

For [Rockkickass.com](http://www.rockkickass.com) we use a website generator that is provided by Github because it's more developer oriented and we get it "for free" because our code for Rock Kickass is hosted there. Tumblr or Wordpress.com would be easy solutions. If you'll be hosting a lot of images, or animated gifs, try uploading them to Imgur first.

We're all in with [Asesprite](http://www.aseprite.org/). We use it to do all of our animations and sprite creation. It's free, open source and it "just works".
