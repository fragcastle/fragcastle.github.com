### In This Episode
Jared and John talk about

We’re making progress on Rock Kickass in ImpactJS, Jared working on some boss art, John working on the BackgroundManager the “falling” level.

Art Process - We’ve been fleshing out ideas in artwork first, and then committing to functionality. It works for us and fits our schedule. We can more easily describe functionality than art to each other.

[A pixel artist renounces pixel art](http://www.dinofarmgames.com/a-pixel-artist-renounces-pixel-art/)

John’s opinion on art - Do what art you like. There will be others that will like it too.

John is having controller woes with his Afterglow 360 controller - [Tattie Bogle](http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver) doesn’t seem to work quite right? -

Not [this Tattie Bogle](http://sco.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattie-bogle)

We’re kicking around the idea of streaming some coding or artwork process… let us know if this sounds like something you want us to do.
