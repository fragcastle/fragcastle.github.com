### In This Episode
Jared and John talk about

- sorry audio only people John has a spinning tree and we _have_ to talk about it
- also, Jared left john as the primary video feed for the first part of the podcast
- heads up, theres a new version of [aseprite](http://blog.aseprite.org/post/102450933330/aseprite-1-0-6-released) the best pixel image editor ever
- we talk about [how long it takes to make a indie game](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JosephMirabello/20140407/214931/How_Long_Does_It_Take_to_Make_an_Indie_Game.php) an excellent blog post by Tower of Guns developer Joseph Mirabello
- it's been 7 months since we entered BFIG and 4 months since the expo and we haven't received our reviewer feedback, we're kind of upset and worried that the review teams feedback is lost
- one of Jared's new years resolutions is to make one game a month, and possibly ship 3 of them to the app store
- We've been around for 2 1/2 years and we feel like we don't have a lot to show for it, demos are not games
- John is thinking about working on a few different game types: Flappy Bird clone, a tower defence game
- **Rock Kickass** isn't dead, but we're re-assessing the core gameplay and making sure that we fail faster with it
- **RK Runner** development hell is done, we're probably going to take it off of the app stores in a few months
- **Shroom Jump** is a game made by John for a conference, we really liked it and decided to release it for iOS. [Get it today!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shroom-jump/id947864437?mt=8)
- Check out [Jan Willem Nijman's talk "The art of screenshake"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJdEqssNZ-U)
