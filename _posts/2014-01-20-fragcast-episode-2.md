FragCast is a weekly podcast where the founders of Frag Castle Games talk about the latest progress on their games, the video game industry, pop culture and the ups and downs of running a super-small, lean startup.

 * We both answer questions that Jareds Wife asked about game development:
     * "How do you share your ideas with the public while still preventing people from copying them?"
     * "How do you handle constructive criticism from people? What if it's not constructive?"
     * "What software do you use to share your ideas for games?"
 * Jared briefly mentions [Game Feel: A Game Designers Guide to Virtual Sensation](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Feel-Designers-Sensation-Kaufmann-ebook/dp/B0048EJXP2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1390106012&sr=8-1&keywords=game+feel)
