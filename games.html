          Rock Kickass is an 8-bit, platformer that we built for the Github Game-off. After the competition ends we're planning to develop more enemies, levels and powerups and then release the game on Android/iPhone and Windows8.<br />
          <br />Until then, you can play the current version <a href="http://fragcastle.com/rock-kickass">here</a>.

          In the future, earths first contact with alien life won't go exactly as we expected. Joe Storm was just your average member of the 14th earth space marine detachment assigned as a security force for an earth outpost.<br />
          <br />One day the outpost is attacked by a previously unknown spaceship. During a counter-attack, Joes ship is surrounded by a blue light and disappears. Now, he must face wave after wave of never-before-seen enemy forces so that he can become the victor of the vicious alien "sport" that he has been entered into.
